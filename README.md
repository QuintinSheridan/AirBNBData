# Files
* airBNB.ipy - Jupyter notebook with data anlysis
* Data/boston_calendar.csv - calender data for Boston
* Data/boston_listings.csv - listings data for Boston
* Data/boston_reviews.csv - reviews data for Boston
* Data/seattle_calendar.csv - calender data for Boston
* Data/seattle_listings.csv - listings data for Boston
* Data/seattle_reviews.csv -  reviews data for Boston

Data sets can be found here:
* https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data
* https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston

# Results
The prices in both cities very with the time of year.  Modeling the time of year as a categorical variable gives the best performance when trying to predict price based on on properties of the AirBNB rental.  Prices and accomodation very more in Boston than Seattle.

# Requirements
All required python libraries can be found in requirements.txt.
