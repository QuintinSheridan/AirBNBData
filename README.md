Jupyter notebook project to analyze one years worth of AirBNBData from Boston and Seattle.

# Files
-airBNB.ipy - Jupyter notebook with data anlysis
Data/
-boston_calendar.csv - calender data for Boston
-boston_listings.csv - listings data for Boston
-boston_reviews.csv - reviews data for Boston
-seattle_calendar.csv - calender data for Boston

# Results
The prices in both cities bvery with the time of year.  Modeling the time of year as a categorical variable gives the best performance when trying to predict price based on on properties of the AirBNB rental.  Prices and accomodation very more in Boston than Seattle.

# Requirements
All required python libraries can be found in requirements.txt.
